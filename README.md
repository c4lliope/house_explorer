# *House* Coding Challenge

This codebase includes a response to the coding challenge
issued by the House of Representatives' Clerk's office.
Namely, building an application to display API records
of members and roll call votes for the 117th congress.

My goals are to build up in iterations a program to explore the records,
mixing and matching as the user pleases.
To accomplish this goal I will use libraries I am experienced with, including:

* React
* styled-components
* Mobx

I will pull records from the recommended API channels,
plus some additional sources:

* `clerkapi.azure-api.net/Members/v1/...`
* `clerkapi.azure-api.net/Votes/v1/...`
* `congress.gov/img/member/...`
